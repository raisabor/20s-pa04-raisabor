Traveling Salesman with naive and genetic algorithms

The naive technique is the first to run and only operates on the 12 node dataset. The positions12.txt dataset is the only dataset
that the naive technique can opearate on in a reasonable amount of time and resources. 
The genetic algorithm runs on all datasets in the program.
